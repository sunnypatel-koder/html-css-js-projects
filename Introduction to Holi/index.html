        <p>Holi has its roots in Hindu mythology and is associated with several legends. One of the most popular stories behind the festival is the legend of Prahlada and Holika. According to the legend, Prahlada was a devotee of Lord Vishnu and was saved by the god from his evil father Hiranyakashipu. Hiranyakashipu's sister, Holika, who had a boon of being immune to fire, tried to kill Prahlada by sitting with him in a pyre. However, due to the blessings of Lord Vishnu, Holika was burnt to ashes, and Prahlada survived. This event is celebrated as Holi, where the triumph of good over evil is commemorated.</p>
